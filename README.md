Design Decisions

Component Structure:

WorkflowCanvas → Handles the drag-and-drop UI using React Flow.

NodeConfigPanel → Manages node configuration with forms.

WorkflowTable → Displays a summary of nodes.

useWorkflowState → Custom hook for managing workflow data.


Why React Flow?
React Flow simplifies the implementation of graph-based UIs with built-in drag-and-drop and edge management.



---

Assumptions

Users will mainly interact with the UI through drag-and-drop.

Workflows are stored in local state (or persisted in localStorage, if implemented).

Nodes have predefined types, each with specific properties.
